Rest API
=======

Rest API is one of the popular webservices in the world. This code implements Rest API for performing word count operation in a file, sorting array of numbers, checking whether a number is prime or not.
For implementing this API we used flask python frame work. For converting the results in to json format, we used jsonify python library

Usage
-----

### Making a request using POST or GET: ###

#### Sorting array of numbers ####
Sorting array of numbers is required for so many applications. We are providing REST API service for sorting array of numbers.
In this service we are going to pass query parameters to the http url. "array" parameter is of string data-type which we use to send array of numbers as string which are seperated by comma.
Below is the request for sorting 34,7,8,9,1 array of numbers. you can use either GET or POST requests for the below url  
##### API call #####
http://ec2-35-160-1-123.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/sort?array={array of numbers}
##### Parameters #####
**array:**   array of numbers divided by comma where we pass it as string data type
##### Example of API call #####
```API
http://ec2-35-160-1-123.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/sort?array=34,7,8,9,1
```
##### API Response #####
Response from server with header information
```Result

From the above it is clear that server response is in the form of json data type

##### Example of API call #####
```API
http://ec2-35-160-1-123.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api/prime?number=17
```
